# Car Sales Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes car sales data to gain insights and build a predictive model for sales forecasting. The dataset consists of various attributes such as customer demographics, car specifications, and dealership details.

## Insights Gained
- **Customer Trends**: Analysis of gender, income, and region-based sales trends.
- **Popular Models**: Identification of best-selling car models and brands.
- **Sales Patterns**: Seasonal and regional variations in car sales.
- **Dealer Performance**: Evaluation of sales performance by dealership location.

## Model Building
### Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and correlations.
3. **Model Selection**: Testing multiple regression models for sales prediction.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Splitting data into training and testing sets and evaluating performance.

### Model Performance:
- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- **Evaluation Metric**: R-squared
- **Score Achieved**: 0.005 --> 0.5%
